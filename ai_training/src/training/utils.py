    """
    Saves the current state of the model and optimizer as a checkpoint.

    This function stores the state of the model, optimizer, and the current epoch
    in a dictionary and writes this dictionary to a file specified by 'checkpoint_path'.

    Args:
        model (torch.nn.Module): The model to be saved.
        optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): The optimizer whose state will also be saved.
        epoch (int): The current epoch to record in the checkpoint.
        checkpoint_path (str): The file path where the checkpoint will be saved.

    Returns:
        None

    Side Effects:
        - Saves a checkpoint on the disk.
        - Prints a confirmation message to the console.
